# Unreal Engine 5 Base

## Overview

This is a base I quickly put together for Unreal Engine 5 games, with Deceit 2 as the main target. It's designed to help you write cheats for any Unreal Engine game since the core principles are pretty much the same across the board.

## Purpose

The idea here is to give you a head start if you're looking to dive into cheat development for Unreal Engine 5 games. It takes care of the heavy lifting with game memory and overlay rendering, so you can focus on the fun part—creating your cheats. Whether you're working on Deceit 2 or any other UE5 game, this base has got you covered with the essentials.

## Key Concepts

- **Universal Design**: While I had Deceit 2 in mind, the methods here work for any Unreal Engine 5 game, making it super adaptable.
- **Learning Tool**: This project lays out the common practices in cheat development, perfect if you're just getting started.
- **Quick Prototyping**: With this framework, you can jump right into testing your ideas without building everything from scratch.

## Usage

This is meant for educational purposes. It’s a great way to learn about game memory management and overlay techniques, showing you how cheats can be structured and implemented.
